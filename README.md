## Automated Testing Farm Management Project

This testing is conducted to facilitate the regression testing process, which is the most commonly used method to ensure the quality of software that undergoes changes due to change requests. Automated testing is carried out using the Robot Framework, with scripts created based on previously designed test cases. The automated testing is only conducted on the Farm Management and Kandang Management modules, while the Report Management module is still under development by the engineer.

The elements required when writing the script include settings, variables, keywords (PO and APP), and test cases.
This automated testing uses several technologies, including Selenium as a library, Robot Framework as the framework, and Visual Studio Code as the IDE to run the script. The automated testing consists of four sections:

1. Settings to import libraries or resources.
2. Variables to declare variables that will be used in test cases and keywords.
3. Test Cases to describe the steps that will be executed during the testing process.
4. Keywords to create functions that will be used during the testing process.
